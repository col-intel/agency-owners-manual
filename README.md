# The First Year's Agency Owner's Manual

**For solo agency founders validating service businesses without cold outreach.**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a lean, pricing-based agency by validating *paid client demand* through **Minimum Viable Services (MVS)** in 4-week rapid feedback loops.  
No fluff, no vanity metrics — just usage, payment, and retention.

---

## 🔁 The 4-Week Loop

Each loop has a single **Vision Epic**, tested weekly with focused sprints.  
Everything is structured around **Product** and **Growth**. Keep **Ops** lightweight.

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Week 1 – Vision & First Pilot**  
- Define: Target customer + pain + service  
- Secure 1 *paid* or *committed* pilot  
- Deliver MVS manually (concierge-style)

**Week 2 – Usage & Iteration**  
- Observe usage patterns  
- Patch friction points  
- Ship 1 small value-adding improvement

**Week 3 – Monetization Test**  
- Propose pricing or upsell  
- Watch for payment objections  
- Track usage-to-payment conversion

**Week 4 – Reflect & Decide**  
- Summarize learnings  
- Validate or kill core assumptions  
- Decide: **Persevere**, **Patch**, or **Pivot**  
- Set next 4-week vision

## 🧪 Weekly Rhythm

**Monday – Plan**  
- Set 1 Learning Goal (hypothesis)  
- Set 1 Delivery Goal (what to ship/test)

**Tue–Thu – Execute**  
- Deliver service  
- Talk to clients  
- Collect qualitative & usage data

**Friday – Reflect**  
- Did we hit the Delivery Goal?  
- What was learned?  
- What hard truth was validated?  
- What’s the next action?

---

## ✅ What to Validate Early

- Will they **pay** without discounts?  
- Will they **use** the service more than once?  
- Is the **value obvious** without your constant input?

---

## 🛠 Tooling Stack

- **Linear** – for Product tasks & weekly sprints  
- **Notion** – for Vision Epics, Client Tracker, Experiment Log

## 🧭 Vision Epic Template

# Vision Epic – [Cycle Name / Dates]

## 🎯 Objective
One sentence describing the core goal of this cycle.

> Example: "Convert 2 paying pilot clients for our upsell concierge service targeting boutique hotels."

## 🧪 Hard Truths to Validate
List 2–3 critical assumptions that, if false, invalidate this cycle.

- HT1: Will clients pay at least €X/month for [service]?
- HT2: Will clients use the service without constant prompting?
- HT3: Is upsell revenue a strong enough incentive?

## ✅ Success Criteria
Define what would make this loop a win.

- [ ] 2 paying clients
- [ ] 3+ service usages per client
- [ ] 1 client asks for more / refers another

## 🔭 Strategic Focus
Choose one primary focus:

- ☐ Acquire
- ☑ Validate Usage
- ☐ Monetize
- ☐ Systematize

## 📌 Key Deliverables
List high-impact actions or milestones.

- Deliver onboarding flow to 1st pilot
- Send MVS report for their first upsell
- Run payment proposal with 2nd pilot

## 📁 Resources
- [Client Tracker](#)
- [Experiment Log](#)
- [MVS Template](#)

## 🧘‍♂️ Founder Reminder
Write a quick personal note. “What would make this month a win *for you*?”

> If I learn which type of client is most engaged and which use case is strongest, I’ll count this cycle a success.

## 🔁 Weekly Sprint Template

# Sprint Week X – [Date Range]

## 🎯 Learning Goal
What hypothesis are we testing?

> "If we simplify the upsell flow, pilot client A will use it twice this week."

## 📦 Delivery Goal
What will we ship or do to test it?

- Update MVS with improved email summary
- Deliver feature manually if needed
- Schedule usage check-in with client

## 🚧 Tasks (Product / Growth / Ops)
### Product
- [ ] Create new MVS doc template
- [ ] Update Linear tasks for usage logging

### Growth
- [ ] Meet with Pilot A (Wed)
- [ ] Ask for testimonial if engagement > 3x

### Ops
- [ ] Draft simple invoice for new client
- [ ] Update CRM in Notion

## 📊 Metrics to Watch
- # of times pilot clients use the service
- Feedback or blockers surfaced
- Payment confirmations or objections

## 🔁 Friday Retro
**Did we meet our goals?**  
- Learning: ✅ / ❌  
- Delivery: ✅ / ❌

**What did we learn?**  
> Usage increased only after direct prompting. Need to automate reminders.

**Next step:**  
> Test passive usage triggers next week.

**Next week’s working theme:**  
> "Can the service nudge clients without my involvement?"

---

## 📈 Definition of Success

- 2–3 **paying pilots** within 4–8 weeks  
- Evidence of repeat usage  
- Service works *without* founder doing 100% manually  
- Pricing validated by actual transactions
